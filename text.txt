Attackers build networks of infected computers,
known as 'botnets', by spreading malicious software
through emails, websites and social media.
Once infected, these machines can be controlled remotely,
without their owners' knowledge, and used like an
 army to launch an attack against any target

Botnets can generate huge floods of traffic to overwhelm
a target. Some attacks are so big they can max
out a country's international cable capacity

Chargen Reflection - Steady streams of text

to saturate the connection. The connections
are kept alive by sending small bits of
data. A low bandwidth DOS attack.
